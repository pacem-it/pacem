`PacemFetchElement` is the predefined custom element that handles the asynchronous __http__ communication with the server side of your application.

It basically wraps the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

## Requests
`PacemFetchElement` sends a request as soon as:
- A `url` property/attribute is provided **and**...
- it is not `disabled`.

Then, it will wait for one of the following properties to change in order to **trigger a new request**:  
- `url`: the target url, 
- `method`: the case-insensitive HTTP method, 
- `parameters`: the key-value pairs to be sent in the body/querystring of the request, 
- `headers`: the key-value pairs to be sent in the header of the request, 
- `as`: the type of expected response (`"object"`/json, `"text"`/string, `"blob"`, `"image"`), 
- `type`: possible values are `"json"` (default) or `"raw"` for _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_ content-types, 
- `mode`: possible values are `"cors"` (default), `"no-cors"`/string, `"navigate"`, `"same-origin"`, 
- `credentials`: possible values are `"same-origin"` (default), `"omit"`, `"include"`, 
- `disabled` (in the case it changes to `true`).

Calling the **method** `fetch()` **triggers a new request** as well (if not disabled, of course).

While a response is awaited, the `fetching` flag is set to `true` (and emits relevant `propertychange` event).

## Responses
When a response is obtained, the `fetching` flag is set to `false` (and emits...).

Once the response body has been parsed into the expected entity:
- `result` property value is set consequently,
- `fetchresult` custom event is fired (having the entity as _detail_).

If anything went wrong:
- `error` custom event is fired (having the response itself as _detail_).
